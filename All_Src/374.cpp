/*
 * Problem:
 *
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:I pick a number 
 * from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.Every time you 
 * guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
 *
 * You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible
 * results (-1, 1, or 0):
 *
