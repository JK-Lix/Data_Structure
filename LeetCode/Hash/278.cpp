/*
 * Problem:
 *
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a
 * new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails 
 * the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the 
 * previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out 
 * the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.You 
 * are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 *
